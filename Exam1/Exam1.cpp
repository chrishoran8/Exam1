int main()
{
    //1) declare a type int called intOne (2)


    //2) declare a type int called intTwo (2)


    //3) declare a type int called intThree (2)


    //4) declare type float called floatOne (2)


    //5) assign intOne the value of 3 (2)


    //6) assign intTwo the value of 5 (2)


    //7) assign floatOne the value of 3.0f (2)


    //8) use the multiplication operator to multiply intOne with intTwo 
    //use intThree to store the result (3)


    //9) increment intThree  (3)


    //10) initialise a type char called myChar to the value 'a' (2)


    //11) output the value intThree and myChar to the screen  (3)


    //12) declare a variable of type int called userValue  (3)


    //13)  prompt the user to provide an input to userValue (2)    


    //14) after prompting, get a variable from the user of type int called userValue. (3) 


    //15) take the input and apply a decision based on the number inputted . 
    //The decision should be based on if the user inputs a number above 10 
    //the code should output "above 10" (8)


    //16) create an array of type int with 10 elements called myArray (8)


    //17 part a) create a for loop to iterate through the above array and populate the array with 
    //{0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18} 
    //(6 marks)


    //17 part b) create a for loop to iterate through the above array and output its contents
    //ensure each number is shown on the same line, but a space separates them all (6 marks)
 
   
    //18) initialise a variable of type int called cost to 100 (2) 


    //19) create a pointer pointing to the above variable called costPtr (4) 


    //20) create a function which calculates the VAT on the cost called calcVat (13) 
    //The function should be declared in the correct file and defined in the correct file
    //the function should take a cost parameter and return the VAT. Vat is an increase of 20%
    //the function requires to take a type float as parameter and return type float    
    //test the function here:


    //21) using the below string
    string s1 = "Hello, ";
    string s2 = "How Are You";
    string fullGreeting = "";
    //use a string method, join s2 to s1 (5) 


    //22) using a string method, calculate the length of the s1 string and 
    //assign to lengthFG. Output the value to the console (5) 
    int lengthFG;



    //23) use a string method to take out the "How" part of the string and output(5) 


    //24) using a different string method to what you have used in above code
    // add the "!" character to the end of the string. Output the string.  (5)
