    //1) declare a type int called intOne (2)
    int intOne;

    //2) declare a type int called intTwo (2)
    int intTwo;

    //3) declare a type int called intThree (2)
    int intThree;

    //4) declare type float called floatOne (2)
    float floatOne;

    //5) assign intOne the value of 3 (2)
    intOne = 3;

    //6) assign intTwo the value of 5 (2)
    intTwo = 5; 

    //7) assign floatOne the value of 3.0f (2)
    floatOne = 3.0f;

    //8) use the multiplication operator multiply intOne with intTwo 
    //use intThree to store the result (3)

    //9) increment intThree  (3)

    //10) initialise a type char called myChar to the value 'a' (2)

    //11) output the value intThree to the screen  (3)
    

    //12) declare a variable of type int called userValue  (3)

    //13)  prompt the user to provide an input to userValue (2)    
    
    //14) after prompting, get a variable from the user of type int called userValue. (3) 

    //15) take the input and apply a decision based on the number. The decision should be 
    //based on if the user inputs a number between 0 and 10, 
    //the code should output "less than 10" (8)

    //16) create an array of type int with 10 elements (8)

    //17) create a for loop to iterate through the above array and populate the array with 
    //{2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20} 
    //(12 marks)

    //18) create a variable of type int called cost (2) 

    //19) create a pointer pointing to the above variable called costPtr (4) 

    //20) create a function which calculates the VAT on the cost (13). 
    //The function should be declared in the correct place and defined in the correct place
    //the function should take a cost parameter and return the VAT. Vat is an increase of 20%
    //the function requires to take a type float as parameter and return type float

    //21) using the below string
    string s1 = "Hello, ";
    string s2 = "How Are You";
    string fullGreeting = "";
    //use a string method, join s2 to s1 (5) 
    
    //22) using a string method, calculate the length of the string and assign to lengthFG (5) 
    int lengthFG;

    //23) use a string method, dislay only the "How" part of the string (5) 

    //24) use a string method, add the "!" character to the end of the string (5)
